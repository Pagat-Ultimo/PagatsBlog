For quite some time, I’m thinking about creating my own blog, so i don’t have to hide when hanging out with all the other cool kids out there. Today everyone has some kind of a block, be it a website, a profile on a social media platform or just some  WhatsApp groups. People share their adventures, emotions or ‘just’ their day to day life. I never really enjoyed sharing my lunch meal with the world. I don’t even think anyone is actually interested in it. But I do like to share my experiences in the world of software development. That’s something I feel, people are able to profit of.
